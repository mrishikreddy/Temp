### Projects


1. [SRU Coding Club Website](https://github.com/mrishikreddy/SRU-Coding-Club-Website)  
   A scalable full-stack site for SRU's coding club using Next.js and Firebase, featuring real-time authentication, leaderboard, chatbot, and admin panels optimized for 10K+ users.

2. [Web Application Paradise Resorts](#)  
   A fully responsive static web app showcasing room types, events, and support for a luxury resort. Inspired by a Maldives theme, the design optimization led to a smoother UX and improved engagement.
   
3. [Portfolio Website](https://rishik.tech)  
  A personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, projects, and professional achievements. The design focuses on a sleek, modern user experience with a dark theme and easy navigation, highlighting my expertise in web development, AI, and system programming.

4. [AI Chatbot](#)  
   Designed to simulate human-like conversations, this chatbot utilizes natural language processing techniques and context awareness to handle real-time queries with meaningful responses.

5. [Mail Sender](#)  
   Built using Node.js and Nodemailer, this project offers an efficient way to automate the process of sending emails, whether it's for newsletters, contact forms, or transactional messages.

6. [ProblemBox](#)  
   A visually modern platform allowing users to submit anonymous feedback or issues. It includes a responsive UI with glassmorphism design and real-time email notifications for each submission.


7. [Customer Segmentation and Service Prediction](#)  
   Data science project that uses clustering algorithms (like K-Means) to segment customers based on behavioral data, followed by classification models to predict what services or products they're likely to need. Great for businesses looking to enhance customer personalization.
8. [Image classifier.ipynb](#)  
   A deep learning notebook that classifies input images into predefined categories using a trained Convolutional Neural Network. It includes data augmentation and evaluation metrics.

9. [Image describer.ipynb](#)  
   A deep learning model combining CNN and LSTM architectures to generate natural language descriptions for input images. It demonstrates the integration of computer vision with sequence modeling.

10. [Image_Recognition.ipynb](#)  
   A Jupyter Notebook project implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images from various categories. It includes preprocessing, training, evaluation, and accuracy visualization.

11. [Predicting Optimal Drug Prescription Using ML](#)  
    This machine learning project leverages classification techniques to suggest the most suitable drug prescription based on various patient attributes like age, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. It's a healthcare-related predictive modeling application.

12. [Prediction_of_CO2_emissions.ipynb](#)  
   A regression-based project aimed at predicting CO2 emissions of vehicles using features like engine size, fuel type, and transmission. It showcases data visualization, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

13. [Restaurant order management system.c](#)
    Console-based restaurant ordering system written in C. It uses linked lists to manage menu items, track orders, and compute bills. A great example of how data structures can simulate real-world services.

14. [Student management system.c](#)  
     A complete CLI student database system in C, enabling users to add, delete, search, and update student records. The program demonstrates structured data storage and dynamic memory handling.
    
15. [Tic Tac Toe.py](#)  
    A clean, responsive website that brings the classic Tic Tac Toe game to the browser. The user plays against a smart AI in a dynamic and interactive layout optimized for all screen sizes.

16. [Scholars Companion.c](#)  
    A C program built to support students academically. It includes modules like GPA calculation, academic planning, and shortcut links to educational resources. Designed as a multipurpose command-line companion for students.

17. [Smart Vehicle Parking System](#)  
  An IoT-based system that scans vehicle number plates, assigns parking slots, calculates parking fees, and updates statuses in real-time via a Next.js dashboard, with data stored in Firebase.

18. [Attendance calculator](#)  
  This project is an attendance calculator that estimates the number of additional classes a student must attend in each subject to reach 75% attendance. It uses user-input percentages and simulates class schedules based on the selected date

19. [Custom Harris Hawnks Optimizer](https://github.com/mrishikreddy/NNFL/blob/main/NNFL_Project_HHO.ipynb)  
  A project focused on optimizing neural networks with the Harris Hawks Optimizer (HHO) and a custom version, achieving high accuracy improvements.

20. [Algoroot Full-Stack Web Application](#)  
   A real-time website for a company featuring sign-in, sign-out, and password recovery functionalities. Users can view their details in a dashboard, and the site includes pages like Navigation, About, Services Products, Partner, Career, Contact, and Portfolio, with a profile icon displaying logged-in user information.
